The computer vision and Semantic Segmentation projects I have undertaken. 

## Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge
**A Multi-Regression model for classification of Morphology of Galaxies.**

This repository showcases the work I did for the  [Galaxy Zoo Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge)  on Kaggle. I took up this challenge as a personal project much later after it's completion. My submission **beat the 3rd ranked submission**, coming very close to the 2nd ranked submission.

## SpaceNet Buildings v1
This repository showcases the work I did for SpaceNet [Buildings Footprint Extraction Challenge Round 1](https://spacenet.ai/spacenet-buildings-dataset-v1/). The challenge tasked competitors with finding automated methods for **extracting map-ready building footprints** from satellite imagery of the city **Rio de Janerio**. This helps to move toward more accurate, fully automated extraction of buildings aimed at creating better maps where they are most needed.

As a part of this project, I designed a **model training pipeline** using the Fastai Library.
